    <h2>What is HTML used for?</h2>
    <p>
      HTML is used to create and structure web pages. It organizes content such
      as text, images, links, and headings so that browsers know how to display
      them properly. HTML serves as the basic foundation of a website, allowing
      information to be presented clearly on the internet.
